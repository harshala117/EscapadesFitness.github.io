					<h2>Utkatasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits </h4> Sadly, Chair Pose does not involve a chair or actual sitting of any kind. Happily, chair pose is a great exercise for your legs and core, plus it gently elevates heart rate and increases circulation.
					<h4>Time:</h4>Remain in the pose for 30 to 60 seconds
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Start in Mountain Pose and raise your hands straight up. Maintain that “my head is being lifted to the ceiling” feeling as you bend your knees.

With hips moving backward, bend your knees as if you were sitting in an imaginary chair. If you can, try to get your thighs parallel to the floor.

					<h2>Vrksasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits </h4> Yes, this looks hard. But you don’t need to get your heel all the way to your genitals for this to be an effective pose. Tree Pose is ideal for strength and balance. The key is to start small.
                      <h4>Time:</h4> Hold for at least 30 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.

					<h4>Do it:</h4>Start in Mountain Pose. Raise your right leg. To start, place your right foot by your left ankle. Turn your right leg out to the side, rotating from the hip. Keep a sense of grounding in your left leg, keep that lifted posture, and try to balance.

					<h2>Paschimottanasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits</h4>An excellent stretch for the back and hamstrings, this pose also offers a great chance to recenter on your breath and calm your thoughts. 
					<h4>Time:</h4> Hold for at least 30 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.

					<h4>Do it:</h4>Sit on the floor with your legs out straight. Keeping your posture lifted, bend at your hips and reach toward your toes. If you can’t reach your toes, use a towel (or strap). Don’t collapse your body onto your legs.

					<h2>Balasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4>You can use this pose at the end of your practice or whenever you need a break. Child’s Pose gently stretches along the back and gives you a chance to refocus on your breath and relax. 
					<h4>Time:</h4>Keep the pose for at least 30 seconds, though you could stay in it for 30 minutes if you felt like it. 
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Kneel on the floor with your big toes touching. Move the knees about hip-width apart. Sit back on your heels and lay your upper body between your thighs. Imagine lengthening your spine and releasing your shoulders as you relax into the pose.

					<h2>Viparita Karani</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4>This increases circulation to your chest and gently stretches the legs and lower back. It’s extremely calming and you can do it wherever you have a wall.
					<h4>Time:</h4> Stay in the pose for at least 1 minute, though you can go up to 15 minutes if it’s comfortable for you.
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Place folded blankets under your pelvis for support about 5 to 6 inches away from the wall. Lay on your back on the support, then move your legs up the wall. Your legs should be straight (if possible) and vertical.

					<h2>Uttana shishosana
</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4> If flexibility is not one of your strengths (we get you), Downward Dog might often seem a pose of disappointment. You’re not the only one who’s Down Dog may look more like Sad Dog That Just Wants to Lay Down. 
					<h4>Time:</h4>Hold the pose for 30 to 60 seconds.
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Put your hands on the back of a chair with your arms shoulder-width apart. Move your feet back until they’re right under your hips. Your body should be at a 90-degree angle. Stay in this right-angle pose and gently pull the hips and hands away from each other.

					<h2>Setu Bandha Sarvangasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4> This energizing backbend opens your chest and stretches your neck and spine. It can calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and help improve digestion.
					<h4>Time:</h4>Do it for 3-4mins.
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Lie faceup with knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides with palms facedown. Keep your feet parallel and hip-width apart, heels stacked under knees.

On an inhale, activate through the legs and the glutes. Press the floor away with your feet and lift the hips off the floor toward the sky.

					<h2>Savasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4> 
					<h4>Time:</h4>Do it for 5 min.
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Yep, it’s as simple as it sounds. Every yoga class includes Savasana, which relaxes the whole body and gives you space to absorb the benefits of the practice.
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="./img/yoga 9.gif">
					<h2> Urdhva Mukha Svanasana</h2>
					<h4>Benefits: </h4>You’ll open up your chest and shoulders, while stretching the abdominals and hip flexors. This pose comes after chaturanga in a classic Sun Salutation.
					<h4>Time:</h4>Hold it for 30 seconds.
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Lie facedown on the floor. Bend elbows and place hands on the mat in line with lower ribs. Hug your elbows in line with your torso. Tuck your toes and take an inhale.

As you exhale, push the floor away like a push-up. Straighten your arms and broaden across the chest, hovering your hips a few inches above the floor at the same time.
