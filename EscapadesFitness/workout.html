					<h2>Hardstyle plank </h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> None
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Lying face down on the ground, prop yourself up into a forearm plank position. Make sure your elbows are aligned underneath your shoulders, and that your hands are balled up in fists. Your forearms should be parallel to one another. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds per set.

					<h2>Dead bug</h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> None
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Lay face up on the floor with arms straight above your shoulders. To start, bring your knees directly over your hips and bend at the knee so that your calf forms a 90-degree angle with your thigh. Next, simultaneously lower your left arm above your head while straightening your right leg and sending it towards the floor. Pause, return to the starting position, and then repeat on the opposite side. Do 14 alternating reps to complete one set.

					<h2>Hollow extension-to-cannonball</h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> None
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Get into a cannonball-type shape on your back, hugging your knees into your chest—yes, just like you’re at the pool at summer camp again. Simultaneously extend your legs and arms outwards into a “hollow” position, pressing your lower back to the floor. Hold for five seconds before curling up again, and complete five reps for one set.

					<h2>Arnold chest press</h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> Heavy set of dumbbells
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Start by lying flat on a bench holding a dumbbell in each hand, pressed directly overhead with your palms facing towards your feet. Lower the weights down towards the chest while rotating your wrists clockwise, so that the palms face your face at the bottom of the movement. Slowly return to the starting position for one rep. Do three sets of six reps.

					<h2>Svend press</h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> Two five-pound plates
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Start standing with your feet at shoulder-width distance, shoulders back, and two five-pound plates pressed against one another at chest height. Inhale, then press the plates directly out in front of you. When your elbows are fully extended, squeeze through your chest, lift up slightly, and pause. Then, squeeze the middle of the plates and return to the starting position. That's one rep. Do three sets of 15.

					<img src="./img/push up ladder.gif">
					<h2>Push-up ladder</h2>
					<h4>Equipment: </h4> The floor
					<h4>Do it:</h4>Start in high plank position, with your arms slightly wider than shoulder-width distance. Keeping the core tight, lower your body down towards the ground, and push back for one rep. Do eight. Then, bring your hands closer together, so that your shoulders are directly over your wrists. Do eight more. Next, bring your hands even closer, forming a diamond shape with your thumb and index finger on the ground. Do eight more. Finish the ladder by reversing the order, for a total of 40 push-ups per set.
